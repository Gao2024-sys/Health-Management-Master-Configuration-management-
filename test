Verification function implementation:
Check that the HMMS fulfills all the functional requirements of the design.
Verify that user input is processed correctly and that the correct output is generated.
User interface test:
Make sure the user interface (UI) is intuitive, easy to use, and in line with user habits.
Check that UI elements (such as buttons, text boxes, and so on) respond correctly.
Business process testing:
Verify that HMMS is performed correctly according to business processes, such as patient information management, health data entry and analysis.
Exception handling test:
Check whether the HMMS processing mechanism is perfect under abnormal conditions (such as invalid input data, network interruption, etc.).
Security test:
Ensure that HMMS has adequate security, such as data encryption, access control, etc.
Second, performance test
Performance tests are designed to evaluate the performance of HMMS under specific conditions, including response time, throughput, resource utilization, etc. Here are the key points of performance testing:

Response time test:
Measure the time between HMMS receiving a user request and generating a response.
Ensure response times meet user expectations and industry standards.
Throughput test:
Evaluate the ability of HMMS to process requests per unit time.
Check the performance of HMMS when the number of concurrent users increases.
Resource utilization test:
Monitor the usage of CPU, memory, and disk resources when HMMS is running.
Ensure that resource utilization is within a reasonable range to avoid resource bottlenecks.
Stress test:
Simulate user requests in extreme cases to check the HMMS limit processing capacity.
To evaluate the stability and reliability of HMMS under pressure.
3. Compatibility test
Compatibility testing is designed to ensure that HMMS can operate properly in different hardware, operating systems, browsers, and other environments. Here are the key points of compatibility testing:

Hardware compatibility test:
Check HMMS performance on different hardware configurations, such as CPU, memory, and disks.
Ensure HMMS can run stably in various hardware environments.
Operating system compatibility test:
Test HMMS compatibility on different operating systems (such as Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.).
Ensure that HMMS can be installed and run correctly on a variety of operating systems.
Browser compatibility test:
Check the HMMS display and functional performance in different browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
Ensure that HMMS provides a consistent user experience across a variety of browsers.
Database compatibility test:
Test HMMS compatibility with different databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).
Ensure that HMMS can properly connect and operate various databases.
